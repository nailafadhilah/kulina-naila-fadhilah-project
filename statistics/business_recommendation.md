## Raw Conclusion
The conclusion that can be made by the histogram of total purchase quantity to frequency is most users bought only 5 purchases and only a few users made more than 50 purchases in the year of 2019.

Therefore, what I think Kulina should consider to do is to whether:
    1. Attract more users, therefore more possibilites to increase sales, or
    2. Improving the frequency of current users' purchases.

The business recommendations I have come up with is for Kulina to highlight which products does most users most frequent to buy? We can first collect the data using the existing dataframe to make a raw plan to increase sales.

## Final Conclusion
The conclusion that can be made by the pie chart of total product purchases by number of users is certain products are users' favorites among the others. We can utilize this data and make a marketing strategy such as grouping the most favorites products with the less and least favorites products and sell it as a package with exciting discounts.
Therefore, the total sales of the whole products, including the sales of the least favorites one will be more likely to be increased.

The final conclusion of business recommendation according to the data acquired is corresponding with the former raw conclusion from the histogram chart, wherein if Kulina wants to improve the the frequency of current users' purchases, then the suitable way to do it is to make some package meals/products where there is the favorite, less fav, and least fav products in one package while still highlighting the popular product to make it seems like a very good deal by also giving some benefits/discounts.
